- Hello everyone, today I will present a demo of my to-do app developed for the Naver Vietnam AI Hackathon – Mobile Track.

- The app provides simple yet useful features for managing your tasks.

- Adding To-do: Create a task with four key details: Name, Type (School/Work/Housework/Meeting/Other), Priority (Low/Medium/High), and Deadline (down to the minute).

- Editing: You can update all task details after creating them.

- View Types:

- List View: Standard list sorted by the closest deadline.

- Group View: Tasks grouped by type.

- Calendar View: Tasks grouped by deadline (Overdue, Next 20 days, Beyond 20 days).

- Deleting/Completion: You can delete or mark a task as done. Completed tasks move to a history list (up to 100 items), where they can be restored or reviewed later.

- Search: A search bar helps you quickly find tasks.

- Storage: The app uses local file storage to ensure your tasks are always saved and loaded correctly.



🔹 AI-Powered Features

Smart Task Categorization: Use an AI text classifier (via Hugging Face, OpenAI, or other APIs) to automatically assign task Type (School/Work/Housework/etc.) based on the task’s title or description.

Priority Prediction: AI could suggest whether a task should be Low/Medium/High priority based on deadlines, keywords, or historical behavior.

Natural Language Input: Let users type tasks in plain language like “Meeting with John tomorrow at 3 PM”, and use NLP to parse it into structured fields (Name, Type, Deadline).

Smart Reminders: AI could predict the best time to remind you (e.g., before meetings, or when it sees you usually do similar tasks).

Task Summarization: For long notes or descriptions, AI could summarize the key point so the task remains concise.

🔹 Productivity Insights

Habit & Pattern Analysis: Show users insights like “You complete most tasks in the morning” or “You tend to miss high-priority tasks with short deadlines”.

Streaks & Motivation: Gamify productivity by tracking streaks of completed tasks and providing motivational nudges.

🔹 Collaboration & Integration

Shared To-dos: Allow syncing/sharing tasks with friends or teammates.

Calendar Integration: Sync tasks directly with Google Calendar or Outlook.

Voice Assistant Integration: Add tasks by voice (via Google Assistant / Siri).

🔹 UX Enhancements

Adaptive Views: AI could recommend the best view (List, Group, Calendar) depending on your current task load.

Color Coding Suggestions: AI could auto-suggest colors for tasks to visually separate types or urgency.
